## Problem Statement/Summary


A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month. Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.
The dataset here is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store. The store wants to know better the customer purchase behaviour against different products. Specifically, here the problem is a regression problem where we are trying to predict the dependent variable (the amount of purchase) with the help of the information contained in the other variables.
Classification problem can also be settled in this dataset since several variables are categorical, and some other approaches could be "Predicting the age of the consumer" or even "Predict the category of goods bought". This dataset is also particularly convenient for clustering and maybe find different clusters of consumers within it.
Our main concern here is: how do the age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city, and product category help predict the total purchase_amount. So people from certain demographics purchase from certain categories which predicts the price.
